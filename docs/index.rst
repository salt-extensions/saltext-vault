``saltext-vault``: Integrate Salt with HashiCorp Vault
======================================================

This Salt Extension provides modules for interacting with Vault by HashiCorp,
a secrets and encryption management system. You only need to setup your Salt master,
which will then orchestrate minion authentications for you.

Currently, you can
------------------
* manage and dynamically retrieve secrets from the KV v1 and v2 secret backends
* manage Vault policies
* manage the Database secret engine
* request, renew and monitor short-lived database credentials
* manage and issue certificates via the PKI secret engine
* manage and issue credentials/certificates via the SSH secret engine
* write your own modules on top of the provided utilities

There's more coming though.
